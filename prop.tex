\centerline{{\bf \underline{ The Role of Environment in Galaxy Evolution}}}
\medskip

This work is an extension proposal for our previous ISSI team "The Effect of Dense Environments on Gas in Galaxies over 10 Billion Years of Cosmic Time."  That team was very successful, producing papers, successful telescope proposals, and starting an unexpected new research project that has now become one of the major foci of our group.  Below we describe our renewal proposal, where we discuss our new research areas, our continuing progress in previous research areas, and our team, which consists of a significant number of five new members.

\indent{\bf Filaments as the place where galaxies begin to die?} Galaxies in dense environments
have lower average star-formation rates (SFRs) than field galaxies out
to at least $z \sim 1$ \citep[e.g.][]{Poggianti99,Lewis02,Gomez03,Postman05}.
However, despite tremendous observational effort, it
is still not clear whether the clusters actively alter the gas content
of infalling galaxies or whether they are the final resting place of
dead galaxies whose gas was depleted before entering the cluster
environment.

Studies in the local Universe have found
that the average SFR starts to decline at group densities, which are
comparable to the density at $3-4$ times the cluster virial radius
\citep{Lewis02,Gomez03}.  More recent work at intermediate redshift shows that the suppression of star formation begins as galaxies enter the filaments of the cosmic web \citep{Laigle17, Rerat17}, which is consistent with simulations showing that ram pressure can be boosted by a factor of 10--100 inside a filament \citep{Bahe13}.  Indeed structure formation simulations show that most mass flow into massive halos occurs along filaments \citep{Ramachandra15}, implying that environmental galaxy processing starts far from the cluster core in the cosmic web of structure.    In contrast, spiral galaxies
in the Virgo cluster show evidence of cold gas stripping and truncated
star forming disks
\citep{Koopmann98,Koopmann04,Dale01,Crowl05,Chung07}.  This
demonstrates that the cluster environment is actively altering the
star-formation properties of infalling galaxies.  

One reason for the continuing debate as to which environment dominates galaxy transformation is that most groups have
focused on studying only one phase of the gas in galaxies
(e.g. ionized vs. cold).  To conclusively determine the cause for the
end of star formation in dense environments it is important to study
the fuel of star formation itself.  In addition, because galaxies may
be altered in the cosmic web well outside of the cluster core, it is crucial to probe not only the cluster itself, but also the filament and intermediate (i.e. group) environments through which galaxies pass on
their way into the densest environments.

\indent{\bf A revolution in our characterization of filaments:}  Until recently, filaments around clusters were hard to characterize because their moderate galaxy density contrast against the background makes them hard to distinguish from their lower density surroundings.  For this reason, galaxy environment studies in the past 25 years have focused a simple trilogy of field, group, and cluster environments, with radial distance from the cluster being the best available proxy for density in the infall region \citep[e.g.][]{Lewis02,Patel09}.  Thanks to advances in analysis and technology, however, we can now characterize filaments of large scale structure out to loopback times of 6 billion years.   

For example, \citet{Kim16} has analyzed spectroscopy primarily from SDSS to identify seven well-defined filaments around the Virgo cluster (Fig. 1.)  Only by combining uniform imaging and the massive investment of SDSS spectroscopy over $\sim 5000$deg$^2$  was this possible.  These physical associations of galaxies in our cosmic backyard are ideal for studying the effect of the environment on the stars, gas, and dust as the sources are far enough to efficiently observe in a single pointing of most instruments, but near enough to well resolve spatially with an array of ground and space-based facilities.

We have also made breakthroughs in our understanding of the filaments feeding distant galaxy clusters at $z>0.4$.  These advances have come thanks to the availability of 1~deg$^{2}$ field of view imagers on 4-meter telescopes that have enabled distant filaments to be identified via accurate photometric redshifts and subsequently be confirmed with multi-object spectroscopy on 6--8-meter class telescopes \citep[Fig. 1;][]{Rerat17}.  It has taken years to amass this data but we now have the first ability to study highly pure samples of filament galaxies many virial radii away from clusters, in the regions where they may experience environmental affects for the first time.

\end{figure}

\textbf{The importance of understanding the gas:} Through decades of
work it has become clear that local supply of cold (mostly molecular)
gas determines the SFR of galaxies
\citep{Kennicutt98b,Bigiel08,Leroy08}. Therefore, to truly understand
how the SFRs of galaxies are altered it is necessary to directly probe
the content and spatial distribution of the gas.

Different phases of the gas yield complementary information.  The
content and distribution of ionized gas traces the star formation that
is relatively unobscured by dust while the mid-infrared emission tells
us about the obscured star formation.  Likewise, observations of the
molecular gas constrain the fuel of star formation and its physical
conditions, i.e. temperature, density, and filling factor.  Although
the mass of molecular gas is dominated by $H_2$, which has little
accessible emission due to its lack of a permanent dipole moment and is only visible in shocked gas, we
can use well-calibrated proxies, such as rotationally excited CO.

It is important to study the amount of gas and its spatial
distribution with respect to that of the stars.  A key difference
between the studies of the Virgo core and other local SDSS results mentioned previously is that the
Virgo studies are based on spatially resolved \ha, CO, or HI maps while
the others are insensitive to processes that preferentially affect the
outer radii of galaxies.  This is an important distinction as the most
common mechanisms proposed for depleting gas make different
predictions for the size and symmetry of the gas and stars disks.

In addition, studying spatially-resolved gas and stellar disks {\em in filaments as well as in groups and clusters} can help constrain the relative importance
of physical processes such as ram-pressure stripping, starvation, or tidal effects, because their effectiveness varies with
the density of the intra-cluster, intra-group medium, or intra-filament gas and the
velocity of galaxies relative to each other and that gas.  For example, the removal of cold disk gas through
ram-pressure stripping is expected to be most effective in the cluster
core, whereas galaxy-galaxy interactions, which exhaust the gas supply
through a burst of star-formation, are most effective in groups or
cluster outskirts.  However, galaxies can still experience a 10--100 factor boost in ram pressure stripping in filament environments as they move through the filament gas \citep{Bahe13}.

In a preliminary study, we have found potential signed of gas stripping in that star-forming galaxies in
clusters appear to have had some of their molecular gas stripped while
leaving their SFRs - fueled by the densest gas - unaffected for a time
\citep{Jablonka13}.  While suggestive, these conclusions are based
primarily on local samples, which have numerous problems.  Locally we can spatially resolve the gas to look for stripping effects.  At intermediate redshift we can also effectively look for environmental effects
because galaxies are still actively evolving.  Despite this early progress, the number of
CO measurements in dense environments at intermediate redshift and in filaments at all redshifts is very small and our efforts at
enlarging them have just started.  

\textbf{A revolution in our knowledge of the gas:} We are entering a
new age of possibility in our ability to study how gas is affected by
dense environments thanks to space-based (\spitzer, \herschel, WISE, HST,
JWST) and ground-based (ALMA, IRAM, NOEMA, JVLA, VLT, Nancay)
observatories.  With slitless spectroscopy
observations with HST we are obtaining detailed spatial
maps of star formation in clusters and their infall regions for
systems at $z<0.6$.  HST grism spectroscopy is allowing us to probe
the ionized gas and stellar populations of a sample of the most
distant clusters at redshifts $z>1.5$.  \spitzer, WISE, and \herschel\ have
also given us views of the obscured star formation of galaxies back to
the early epochs of time.  Locally they allow us to map the relative
spatial distribution of the dust and the stars, thus tracing the
stripping of the cold gas.  Millimeter observations at the JVLA, IRAM, NOEMA,
and ALMA are enabling us to directly measure the content of molecular
gas in filament galaxies and we can access HI with JVLA and the Nancay telescope.  Finally, the fully commissioned ALMA and NOEMA are giving us
the ability to measure the spatial distribution of molecular gas in
galaxies, thus directly probing the physical conditions of star
formation as they interact with dense environments.

Each of our proposed ISSI team members is leading 1--2 of the efforts
described above.  We will bring together these resources to
address the following questions: In what environment moving from the
field, into filaments, through groups, and into cluster cores is the gas of galaxies
first affected?  How are the content, distribution, density,
and temperature of the gas altered?  Over what timescales does the
depletion occur?  What are the responsible mechanisms for the gas
removal and do they operate differently in different environments?

\centerline{{\bf \underline{ Our proposed activities}}}
\medskip

We have spent significant observational efforts characterizing the extended environments around galaxy clusters over the past 10~Gyr of cosmic time.  For example, we have well-defined filament catalogs of galaxies in the vicinity of Virgo identified from SDSS and have also expended significant observational effort finding filaments and their member galaxies when the Universe was 5~Gyr younger than its present age (Fig. 1).  Going even further, to 10~Gyr in the past, we have characterized a set of forming clusters that are progenitors of our lower redshift systems.

Now that the environments of our galaxies have been largely characterized, our immediate work is to study specific phases of the gas.  The analysis of individual datasets, which usually focus on an individual
environment, redshift, or gas phase, will be primarily done by the PIs
of those programs.  Collectively our team members are studying the both
densest environments over 10~Gyr of cosmic time and also the extended cosmic web that feeds those dense environments.  However, until we
try to bring all of the results together it will be impossible to form
coherent and broad-reaching conclusions with the data that have been
provided by the revolutionary new facilities.  Performing this
synthesis is one of the main goals of our proposed ISSI team.

\textit{Ionized gas:} The effect of environment on the dense ionized
gas will be determined by combining an HST/WFC3 grism Cycle 20 program
(PI: Rudnick) on the infall regions of 4 intermediate redshift
clusters with a narrow-band imaging survey of Virgo filament galaxies (PI: Finn).  With these programs
we will distinguish between different methods of gas depletion by
determining relative structure of the star-forming and stellar disks.
For example, ram-pressure stripping makes the prediction that the gas
disks will be asymmetric \citep[e.g.][]{Quilis00,Crowl05} with respect
to the stars and that the SFRs in the inner parts of the galaxy should
be the same as or even enhanced with respect to field galaxies
\citep{Koopmann04,Weinmann10}.  Galaxy-galaxy interactions, however,
will result in both the gas and stars being asymmetric.  Finally,
starvation, which describes a weaker version of ram-pressure stripping
\citep[e.g.][]{Larson80}, may only affect the relative sizes of the
gas and stellar disks.  By comparing the \ha\ properties of the filament galaxies to those in clusters and infalling groups, we will be able to determine if the filament and group environments are hosting processes that are important in altering star-forming galaxies and how how that role has evolved over
the last 5~Gyr.
%.  By combining these studies over a large range in redshift and
%cluster or group mass our ISSI team will be able to determine how
%stripping processes have evolved over the last 5~Gyr.

\textit{Obscured star formation:} Infrared observations from
\spitzer, WISE, and \herschel\ probe the emission by dust grains that have
been heated by star formation and can by used to infer the total
infrared luminosity \lir\ and SFR.  Using measurements for clusters at
$z<2$ it is clear that the total SFR in cluster galaxies has declined
faster than the field \citep{Finn10,Saintonge08,Tran10,Alberts14}.
This could be because of ``accelerated evolution'' in clusters
\citep{Papovich12} or because the cluster environment speeds up the
depletion of gas at late times.  To break this degeneracy it is
necessary to look in a more detailed way at the properties of the gas
itself.

To address this we will use completed wide-field
\spitzer\ 24\micron\ observations around 11 clusters at $0.6<z<0.8$
(PI Rudnick) to measure whether there is a location at which the
fraction of vigorously star-forming galaxies drops.  We will also use
\spitzer\ 24\micron\ observations of 9 local groups and clusters (PI Finn; Finn et al. 2017) and WISE 12 and 22\micron\ observations of Virgo filament galaxies (PI Finn) to
compare the spatial distribution of the dust emission in galaxies to
that of their stars .  Active stripping of the dust, which is usually co-spatial with the cold gas, will
result in a spatial offset of the dust emission from the stellar
light, while a mere decoupling of the galaxy from its gas supply will
result in a lower mean intensity and smaller dust emission size.  The
ISSI team will combine these two approaches to determine what the
spatial distribution of the dust is at the same density or
clustercentric radius where a suppression of star formation is seen.

\textit{The fuel for star formation.} To truly understand the
modulation of star formation by reduction in the $H_2$ fuel supply
requires that we observe the cold gas, or at least CO, which is the best tracer
possible.  Thanks to dramatic technological advances in
millimetric interferometry with JVLA, NOEMA, and ALMA and the sensitivity if the IRAM 30m telescope we are now able
to study CO over the full redshift range in which clusters are
growing.  As part of the new efforts initiated by our previous ISSI team we have embarked on an ambitious observational campaign to image Virgo filament galaxies in CO, both with the IRAM 30m dish and with the NOEMA interferometer, the best millimeter interferometer in the northern hemisphere.  We are nearly complete with the IRAM program and are proposing for the NOEMA program in Spring 2017.  We have also made excellent progress on increasing the number of CO detections in intermediate redshift clusters and their surrounding filaments using NOEMA \citep{Jablonka13} and ALMA observations (Jablonka in prep.)  Such measurements are crucial as they have less systematics than lower-redshift measurements
and are being made when the evolutionary rates and gas contents of
galaxies were much higher.  Our ISSI team will continue to use these facilities to
build large samples of galaxies at intermediate redshift.  

As the result of large JVLA and ALMA programs, team members have now detected CO
in 13 galaxies that reside in 4 well characterized $z\sim 1.6$ proto-cluster
(Rudnick et al. submitted to ApJ; Noble et al. in prep).  Taken together with the intermediate
redshift measurements, these programs comprise most of the CO
detections in cluster and filament galaxies outside the nearby universe.  Part of
our ISSI program will be to combine these studies to measure how
molecular gas and star formation relate in dense environments since
$z<2$.  CO measurements for field galaxies at normal IR luminosities
are rapidly increasing, promising a perfect field comparison sample.
This is a particularly important part of our project as it gets to the
heart of what is driving star formation and its cessation, namely the
molecular gas and its depletion.

\textit{Providing crucial constraints for theoretical models.} All of
these observations will give us an unprecedented view of how gas is
being altered in galaxies as they enter cluster environments.  Our
ISSI team will use them to to place very strong constraints on
theoretical models of galaxy formation.  In nearly all of these
models, the gas supply to galaxies is cut off upon their entry to
another more massive dark matter halo.  The exact mechanism for this
``satellite quenching'' is unspecified in the models but is
parameterized as a timescale for the cutoff of the gas supply.  Our
observational programs will directly constrain these models by revealing where the gas supply is cut off, i.e. filaments, the virial radius, cluster
core, in groups, and how fast it is shut off.  Current
attempts at constraining these timescales have revolved around
modeling the buildup of quiescent galaxies and result in uncomfortably
long quenching timescales \citep{McGee11,DeLucia12a}. The fundamental
problem is that the models don't properly treat quenching because the
mechanism is unknown.  We will make crucial steps towards answering
this long-standing question.

\textit{Elucidating measurements with revolutionary facilities:}
Future facilities like JWST and those nearing completion, like ALMA and NOEMA,
will provide us an unprecedented opportunity to study the gas contents
of galaxies as a function of environment.  ALMA and NOEMA open the door to
spatially resolved studies of the cold gas and JWST will allow
the high spatial resolution of the ionized gas.  Our ISSI team has been successful proposing for ALMA to and will build on these efforts with the submission of a proposal to make the first significant census of CO in clusters at $z\sim 1.6$.  Thanks to its large wavelength range and 3D spectral capabilities, JWST will allow us to probe the ionized gas in our intermediate and high redshift samples, at wavelengths unencumbered by extinction (Pa$\alpha$, $\lambda=1.875$\micron).  For our nearby galaxies it will also give us the capability to measure H$_2$ directly, and thus measure the bulk of the cold gas without relying on CO as a proxy.  
A timely effort in the design of these programs is crucial, as JWST has a limited mission lifetime and the first call for proposals is March 2018, right within the timeframe of this proposed team.  
Likewise, given ALMA's completion, our ISSI team
is in a perfect position to propose large programs to study the
cold gas.  A priority of this team will be observing filament galaxies and distant clusters with HST, ALMA, and JWST.

\textbf{Why is our project powerful?}   Collectively, our team has
access to the ideal data to address the questions outlined in our
proposal.  Our filament sample spans $\sim 5~$Gyr of cosmic time while our cluster sample spans $\sim10~$Gyr and
includes the highest redshift cluster with both extremely deep HST
grism data (Lee-Brown et al. 2017) and JVLA data (Rudnick et al. 2017), along with one of the largest sample of CO detections in distant clusters (Noble et al. in prep.)  Importantly, our distant clusters are ideally
suited for evolutionary studies as they are all typical progenitors of
our local clusters (Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008; Rudnick et al. 2012).
At intermediate redshift we probe far enough out in clustercentric
radius to identify all of the members that will end up in the cluster
at $z=0$ (Just et al. 2014).  At low redshift we use the proximity of Virgo and other local clusters to probe to low stellar masses where environmental quenching is thought to be dominant and we access HI, CO, Ionized gas, dust, and stellar mass in all of our target galaxies. 

Our proposed collaboration will also probe nearly all of the phases of
the gas that are relevant for star formation, from the hot dense gas
that traces active star formation to the cold molecular gas that is
the fuel of star formation.  We also probe all relevant densities in the cosmic web, from distant filaments to the bottom of deep cluster potential wells.  By combining our measurements with
theoretical models we will gain a greatly improved understanding of
how star formation is regulated, and eventually quenched, in dense
environments.  This synergy of the appropriate data, in the
appropriate sample, spanning a large range in redshift, and with
accompanying theoretical modeling is unique.


\textbf{Our proposed team:} Our team is composed of 15 highly
recognized experts in various areas of galaxy evolution studies and
represents 6 countries.  They are playing key roles or are leading
projects in one or more of the areas mentioned
above. $\bullet$~\textit{Molecular tracers of star-forming gas:}
F. Combes (F), P. Jablonka (CH), G. Rudnick (USA),
A. Noble (USA), E. van Kampen (DE), J. Hodge (NL), C. Papovich (USA), M. Cooper (USA) $\bullet$~\textit{Ionized tracers of star-forming gas:}
B. Weiner (USA), G. Rudnick (USA)
R. Finn (USA) $\bullet$~\textit{Dust-obscured star formation:} R. Finn
(USA), V. Desai (USA), Norman, D. (USA), G. Rudnick (USA), C. Papovich
$\bullet$~\textit{Galaxy environment:} D. Zaritsky (USA), G. Castigiani (F), V. Desai (USA), P. Jablonka (CH), M. Cooper (USA)
$\bullet$~\textit{Very distant clusters:} G. Rudnick (USA), B. Weiner
(USA), A. Noble (USA), E. van Kampen (D), C. Papovich (USA) $\bullet$~\textit{Theoretical modeling:} G. De
Lucia (IT), M. Cooper (USA).  

This group has five members not in our previous and these new members bring essential expertise to our collaboration.  This group is larger than 12 but we expect that some members will self-fund to come to the workshop.  Such a large group is necessary to ensure that we have the proper cross-section of expertise.

\textbf{The value of ISSI:}  
Historically, studies of the cold gas
have been carried out independently from those that study the effects
of environment.  Even among those studying environment, those studying intermediate density environments like groups and filaments have often been disjoint from those studying the cluster cores.  Likewise, the high redshift cluster community has,
been focused on finding systems, with relatively little work having
been done on the effect of environment on the physical properties of
galaxies.  Making significant progress requires a concerted and
multi-wavelength approach that stretches across large swaths of cosmic
time.  This is a highly valued endeavor as understanding the gas in
galaxies was highlighted in the Astro2010 Decadal report from the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences.  It is also a main focus of ALMA,
the largest Europe-US-Japan project of the decade.  

The funding from ISSI gives us a unique opportunity collaborate over an extended period at the same location.  The value of these meetings are clear.  During our first workshop as part of the previous proposal we organically decided on pursuing the Virgo filament studies, which now forms a backbone of this proposal.  We have an active ISSI-hosted wiki that serves as an information repository, have already produced multiple papers together, and have been successful both in funding and telescope proposals\footnote{\url{http://www.issibern.ch/teams/gasingalaxies/}}.  Extended
face-to-face meetings are critical for such undertakings and the ISSI
funds make this possible as almost none of the collaborators has the
necessary funds from other sources.

\textbf{Outcomes:} Our collaboration will result in multiple high
impact papers.  We will also write a
paper that combines the different studies above into a summary and
synthesis of all we know observationally about the gas in galaxies in
dense environments.  Another paper will combine those observational
constraints with our theoretical modeling to constrain the timescales
and physical mechanisms for the quenching of star formation.

We will submit multiple telescope proposals to ALMA, JVLA, NOEMA, HST, and most importantly JWST 
 to characterize the gas in much larger samples than is currently possible.

\textbf{Schedule:} We propose to hold an initial full team meeting of five days to kick off the project during the summer of 2017. This would be followed by a final 5 day full team meeting in the summer of 2018. 

\textbf{Financial Support:} We request the standard support provided
by ISSI of a per diem for the living expenses of Team members while
residing in Bern and for the travel expenses of the coordinator
(Rudnick). We would also appreciate benefiting from the ISSI Young
Scientist scheme for two young researchers.  

\textbf{Required Facilities.}  We require only meeting facilities and
reasonably fast internet access.

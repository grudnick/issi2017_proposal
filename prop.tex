\centerline{{\bf \underline{ The Role of Environment in Galaxy Evolution}}}
\medskip

This work is an extension proposal for our previous ISSI team "The Effect of Dense Environments on Gas in Galaxies over 10 Billion Years of Cosmic Time."  That team was very successful, producing papers, successful telescope proposals, and starting an unexpected new research project that has now become one of the major foci of our group.  Below we describe our renewal proposal, where we discuss our new research areas, our continuing progress in previous research areas, and our team, which consists of a significant number of five new members.

\indent{\bf Filaments as the place where galaxies begin to die?} Galaxies in dense environments
have lower average star-formation rates (SFRs) than field galaxies out
to at least $z \sim 1$ \citep[e.g.][]{Poggianti99,Lewis02,Gomez03,Postman05}.
However, despite tremendous observational effort, it
is still not clear whether the clusters actively alter the gas content
of infalling galaxies or whether they are the final resting place of
dead galaxies whose gas was depleted before entering the cluster
environment.

Studies in the local Universe have found
that the average SFR starts to decline at group densities, which are
comparable to the density at $3-4$ times the cluster virial radius
\citep{Lewis02,Gomez03}.  More recent work at intermediate redshift shows that the suppression of star formation begins as galaxies enter the filaments of the cosmic web \citep{Laigle17, Rerat17}, which is consistent with simulations showing that ram pressure can be boosted by a factor of 10--100 inside a filament \citep{Bahe13}.  Indeed structure formation simulations show that most mass flow into massive halos occurs along filaments \citep{Ramachandra15}, implying that environmental galaxy processing starts far from the cluster core in the cosmic web of structure.    In contrast, spiral galaxies
in the Virgo cluster show evidence of cold gas stripping and truncated
star forming disks
\citep{Koopmann98,Koopmann04,Dale01,Crowl05,Chung07}.  This
demonstrates that the cluster environment is actively altering the
star-formation properties of infalling galaxies.  

One reason for the continuing debate as to which environment dominates galaxy transformation is that most groups have
focused on studying only one phase of the gas in galaxies
(e.g. ionized vs. cold).  To conclusively determine the cause for the
end of star formation in dense environments it is important to study
the fuel of star formation itself.  In addition, because galaxies may
be altered in the cosmic web well outside of the cluster core, it is crucial to probe not only the cluster itself, but also the filament and intermediate (i.e. group) environments through which galaxies pass on
their way into the densest environments.

\indent{\bf A revolution in our characterization of filaments:}  Until recently, filaments around clusters were hard to characterize because their moderate galaxy density contrast against the background makes them hard to distinguish from their lower density surroundings.  For this reason, galaxy environment studies in the past 25 years have focused a simple trilogy of field, group, and cluster environments, with radial distance from the cluster being the best available proxy for density in the infall region \citep[e.g.][]{Lewis02,Patel09}.  Thanks to advances in analysis and technology, however, we can now characterize filaments of large scale structure out to loopback times of 6 billion years.   

For example, \citet{Kim16} has analyzed spectroscopy primarily from SDSS to identify seven well-defined filaments around the Virgo cluster (Fig. 1.)  Only by combining uniform imaging and the massive investment of SDSS spectroscopy over $\sim 5000$deg$^2$  was this possible.  These physical associations of galaxies in our cosmic backyard are ideal for studying the effect of the environment on the stars, gas, and dust as the sources are far enough to efficiently observe in a single pointing of most instruments, but near enough to well resolve spatially with an array of ground and space-based facilities.

We have also made breakthroughs in our understanding of the filaments feeding distant galaxy clusters at $z>0.4$.  These advances have come thanks to the availability of 1~deg$^{2}$ field of view imagers on 4-meter telescopes that have enabled distant filaments to be identified via accurate photometric redshifts and subsequently be confirmed with multi-object spectroscopy on 6--8-meter class telescopes \citep[Fig. 1;][]{Rerat17}.  It has taken years to amass this data but we now have the first ability to study highly pure samples of filament galaxies many virial radii away from clusters, in the regions where they may experience environmental affects for the first time.

\end{figure}

\textbf{The importance of understanding the gas:} Through decades of
work it has become clear that local supply of cold (mostly molecular)
gas determines the SFR of galaxies
\citep{Kennicutt98b,Bigiel08,Leroy08}. Therefore, to truly understand
how the SFRs of galaxies are altered it is necessary to directly probe
the content and spatial distribution of the gas.

Different phases of the gas yield complementary information.  The
content and distribution of ionized gas traces the star formation that
is relatively unobscured by dust while the mid-infrared emission tells
us about the obscured star formation.  Likewise, observations of the
molecular gas constrain the fuel of star formation and its physical
conditions, i.e. temperature, density, and filling factor.  Although
the mass of molecular gas is dominated by $H_2$, which has little
accessible emission due to its lack of a permanent dipole moment and is only visible in shocked gas, we
can use well-calibrated proxies, such as rotationally excited CO.

It is important to study the amount of gas and its spatial
distribution with respect to that of the stars.  A key difference
between the studies of the Virgo core and other local SDSS results mentioned previously is that the
Virgo studies are based on spatially resolved \ha, CO, or HI maps while
the others are insensitive to processes that preferentially affect the
outer radii of galaxies.  This is an important distinction as the most
common mechanisms proposed for depleting gas make different
predictions for the size and symmetry of the gas and stars disks.

In addition, studying spatially-resolved gas and stellar disks {\em in filaments as well as in groups and clusters} can help constrain the relative importance
of physical processes such as ram-pressure stripping, starvation, or tidal effects, because their effectiveness varies with
the density of the intra-cluster, intra-group medium, or intra-filament gas and the
velocity of galaxies relative to each other and that gas.  For example, the removal of cold disk gas through
ram-pressure stripping is expected to be most effective in the cluster
core, whereas galaxy-galaxy interactions, which exhaust the gas supply
through a burst of star-formation, are most effective in groups or
cluster outskirts.  However, galaxies can still experience a 10--100 factor boost in ram pressure stripping in filament environments as they move through the filament gas \citep{Bahe13}.

In a preliminary study, we have found potential signed of gas stripping in that star-forming galaxies in
clusters appear to have had some of their molecular gas stripped while
leaving their SFRs - fueled by the densest gas - unaffected for a time
\citep{Jablonka13}.  While suggestive, these conclusions are based
primarily on local samples, which have numerous problems.  Locally we can spatially resolve the gas to look for stripping effects.  At intermediate redshift we can also effectively look for environmental effects
because galaxies are still actively evolving.  Despite this early progress, the number of
CO measurements in dense environments at intermediate redshift and in filaments at all redshifts is very small and our efforts at
enlarging them have just started.  

\textbf{A revolution in our knowledge of the gas:} We are entering a
new age of possibility in our ability to study how gas is affected by
dense environments thanks to space-based (\spitzer, \herschel, HST,
JWST) and ground-based (ALMA, IRAM, NOEMA, JVLA, VLT, Nancay)
observatories.  With slitless spectroscopy
observations with HST we are obtaining detailed spatial
maps of star formation in clusters and their infall regions for
systems at $z<0.6$.  HST grism spectroscopy is allowing us to probe
the ionized gas and stellar populations of a sample of the most
distant clusters at redshifts $z>1.5$.  \spitzer\ and \herschel\ have
also given us views of the obscured star formation of galaxies back to
the early epochs of time.  Locally they allow us to map the relative
spatial distribution of the dust and the stars, thus tracing the
stripping of the cold gas.  Millimeter observations at the JVLA, IRAM, NOEMA,
and ALMA are enabling us to directly measure the content of molecular
gas in filament galaxies and we can access HI with JVLA and the Nancay telescope.  Finally, the fully commissioned ALMA and NOEMA are giving us
the ability to measure the spatial distribution of molecular gas in
galaxies, thus directly probing the physical conditions of star
formation as they interact with dense environments.

Each of our proposed ISSI team members is leading 1--2 of the efforts
described above.  We will bring together these resources to
address the following questions: In what environment moving from the
field, into filaments, through groups, and into cluster cores is the gas of galaxies
first affected?  How are the content, distribution, density,
and temperature of the gas altered?  Over what timescales does the
depletion occur?  What are the responsible mechanisms for the gas
removal and do they operate differently in different environments?

\centerline{{\bf \underline{ Our proposed activities}}}
\medskip

We have spent significant observational efforts characterizing the extended environments around galaxy clusters over the past 10~Gyr of cosmic time.  For example, we have well-defined filament catalogs of galaxies in the vicinity of Virgo identified from SDSS and have also expended significant observational effort finding filaments and their member galaxies when the Universe was 5~Gyr younger than its present age (Fig. 1).  Going even further, to 10~Gyr in the past, we have characterized a set of forming clusters that are progenitors of our lower redshift systems.

Now that the environments of our galaxies have been largely characterized, our immediate work is to study specific phases of the gas.  The analysis of individual datasets, which usually focus on an individual
environment, redshift, or gas phase, will be primarily done by the PIs
of those programs.  Collectively our team members are studying the both
densest environments over 10~Gyr of cosmic time and also the extended cosmic web that feeds those dense environments.  However, until we
try to bring all of the results together it will be impossible to form
coherent and broad-reaching conclusions with the data that have been
provided by the revolutionary new facilities.  Performing this
synthesis is one of the main goals of our proposed ISSI team.

\textit{Ionized gas:} The effect of environment on the dense ionized
gas will be determined by combining an HST/WFC3 grism Cycle 20 program
(PI: Rudnick) on the infall regions of 4 intermediate redshift
clusters with a narrow-band imaging ESO Large Programe with the GTC
(PI: Arag\'on-Salamanca) on a z=0.2 supercluster.  With these programs
we will distinguish between different methods of gas depletion by
determining relative structure of the star-forming and stellar disks.
For example, ram-pressure stripping makes the prediction that the gas
disks will be asymmetric \citep[e.g.][]{Quilis00,Crowl05} with respect
to the stars and that the SFRs in the inner parts of the galaxy should
be the same as or even enhanced with respect to field galaxies
\citep{Koopmann04,Weinmann10}.  Galaxy-galaxy interactions, however,
will result in both the gas and stars being asymmetric.  Finally,
starvation, which describes a weaker version of ram-pressure stripping
\citep[e.g.][]{Larson80}, may only affect the relative sizes of the
gas and stellar disks.  By comparing the \ha\ properties of the
cluster galaxies and those in infalling groups, we will be able to
determine if the cluster environment plays an important role in
altering star-forming galaxies and how how that role has evolved over
the last 5~Gyr.
%.  By combining these studies over a large range in redshift and
%cluster or group mass our ISSI team will be able to determine how
%stripping processes have evolved over the last 5~Gyr.
